## Chapter5: THe GENERAL Chracterisitcs of any detector:

### Introduction

- The main characteristics of any detector is that the total (or partial) energy of the radiation is absorbed by the detector mass which then is converted in other form which is more accessible to the human perception.
- The charged radiation will ionise or excite the atomic electrons.
- Neutral radiation have to go for some sort of radiation producing charged particles, which in turn ionize and excite the detector atoms.
- The electrical detectors are modernily used as it will convert the signal into electrical impulses which later can easily be analyzed.

### 5.1 sensitivity

- Sensitivity: The production of usable signal for given type of radiation and energy

The sensitivity of the detector depends on the following characteristics:

1. Cross section and detector mass: This determines the probability of the ionization process.

2. Detector noise: This determine the certain minimum that can only be detected because of the inherite noise present in the electronics of the detector.

3. Material covering the entrance window: The absorbing capacity of the material sets the minimum energy threeshold.

4.
